        <h2>Where flowers become feelings.</h2>

        <p>
            Floré was born from a love for quiet beauty, countryside charm,
            and the emotions flowers carry. We believe blooms are more than
            arrangements — they are gentle expressions of thought, memory,
            and connection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each collection is carefully curated to reflect softness, grace,
            and natural elegance. From delicate petals to timeless palettes,
            every Floré piece is designed to create moments that feel personal
            and unforgettable.
        </p>

        <p class="about-signature">
            Floré is not just about flowers — it is about emotion, atmosphere,
            and the beauty of meaningful gestures.
